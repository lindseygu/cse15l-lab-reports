## Lab report 5: Researching a different command from lab report 3
In lab report 3, I originally researched the `grep` command, so in this lab report I'm going to research the `find` command options.        
### find -name command
the first command I chose is:
```
find written_2 -name ch1.txt
```
the output is:     
```
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Berk/ch1.txt
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch1.txt
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski/ch1.txt
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Kauffman/ch1.txt
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher/ch1.txt
```
the second command
