# Lindsey Gu's Lab Report Week3: Servers and Bugs
## Part 1: Web Server      
I created a web server called String Server that will return the current String added through the query part of the url and keeps the added Strings. The below screenshots shows the codes and what the web page looks like according to the input url.

In this case, the method called is handleRequest, and the relevant argument is the input url and one revelant string variable is str that gets updates with the input argument. From this specific request, the String str changes from an empty String to "Hello". Another value is the input url, which in this case is localhost:4000/add-message?s=Hello. This value is passed to the String list parameter but getQuery function to check if index 0 of the list is "s". Then the string "Hello" is added to str.

In this case, the method called is handleRequest, and the relevant argument is the input url and one revelant string variable is str that gets updates with the input argument. From this specific request, the String str changes from "Hello" to "Hello\n How are you", where \n represents a new line. Another value is the input url, which in this case is localhost:4000/add-message?s=How are you. This value is passed to the String list parameter but getQuery function to check if index 0 of the list is "s". Then the string "How are you" is added to str(which is not "Hello").                                                   
Here's the screenshot of the code(the structure is copied from the given code from lab2, then I make changes to fit this web server example):

## Part 2: Bugs from lab3          
One of the bugs from lab3 is the ReverseInPlace method, the failure-inducing input(two written test cases) is below:     
```
@Test 
public void testReverseInPlace1() {
    int[] input1 = { 1, 2, 3 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 3, 2, 1 }, input1);
	}

@Test 
public void testReverseInPlace2() {
    int[] input1 = { 0, 2, 4, 6 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 6, 4, 2, 0 }, input1);
	}
```           
And here are the results from the JUnit test:
<img width="682" alt="Screen Shot 2023-01-30 at 7 23 38 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122554943/215655095-914daa8b-dae4-4df7-ae7f-5a6be22425c5.png">

<img width="683" alt="Screen Shot 2023-01-30 at 7 28 00 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122554943/215655708-7dbc6d9a-0487-4495-b12c-7482af40484f.png">      
        
An input that  doesnâ€™t induce a failure is:
```
@Test 
	public void testReverseInPlace() {
    int[] input1 = { 3 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 3 }, input1);
	}
```        
According to the output of running the tests, the symptom for the first test is at index 2, the expected value is 1 but the actual is 3. For the second test, at index 2, the expected value is 2 but the actual is 4.                    
The buggy original method is below:         
```
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr){
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length);
        arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
```          
after trying to fix the bug, I changed the method to:       
```
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr){
    int left = 0;
    int right = arr.length - 1;

    while( left < right ) {
        // swap the values at the left and right indices
        int temp = arr[left];
        arr[left] = arr[right];
        arr[right] = temp;

        // move the left and right index
        left++;
        right--;
    }
}
```         
I changed the code this way because for the original method, the given code is trying to change the last index with index 0, but at that time, the index 0 is already changed to the last index number. One way to solve the bug is to store the index numbers before actually do the swap. So I created temp, left and right as int variables to store the values before swaping.         
        
## Part 3       
Something I learned from lab week2 and week3 is the node class in the LinkedListExample. When I first saw the given code, I couldn't understand the the code is trying to do since I never saw something like that before. But later I asked my friends and searched online to learn more about the code in the LinkedListExample. Another thing I learned is how to write run the JUnit test. I've never written test cases before and It's interesting to learn how to write test cases myself and to check for the bugs in a program.
